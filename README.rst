clashcallerbot-reddit
---------------------
**Bot to help plan Clan Wars in reddit.**

`ClashCallerBot`_ was made to help `/r/ClashOfClans <https://np.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans>`_ clans coordinate attacks
during `Clan Wars <https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Wars>`_ (or `Clan War Leagues
<https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_War_Leagues>`_) from within reddit.

For example, someone wants to attack base 1 and 7, but they haven't posted an update in over an hour
and those two bases still haven't been attacked. Is it okay to attack those bases? Did your fellow
clan member die? Who knowsâ€½

Well, if they (or someone on their behalf) had called those bases for a set period of time, you would
know for certain.

Think of **ClashCallerBot** as an independent time keeper that runs entirely within reddit.

Check us out on `/r/ClashCallerBot <https://np.reddit.com/r/ClashCallerBot/>`_.

python-tutorials
----------------

`python-tutorials`_ is a collection of resources to learn the Python programming language. Resources include books and
online courses.

This repo became very nested very quickly, so newer resource materials I use have their own repo (keep reading to see more).
For more information about this repo, check out the `Docs <https://josealermaiii.github.io/python-tutorials/>`_.
