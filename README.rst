GitHub Projects
===============

This is a summary of my projects on GitHub.

A sort of appendix to my main website: `JoseALerma.com`_

clashcallerbot-reddit
---------------------
**Bot to help plan Clan Wars in reddit.**

`ClashCallerBot`_ was made to help `/r/ClashOfClans <https://np.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans>`_ clans coordinate attacks
during `Clan Wars <https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Wars>`_ (or `Clan War Leagues
<https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_War_Leagues>`_) from within reddit.

For example, someone wants to attack base 1 and 7, but they haven't posted an update in over an hour
and those two bases still haven't been attacked. Is it okay to attack those bases? Did your fellow
clan member die? Who knowsâ€½

Well, if they (or someone on their behalf) had called those bases for a set period of time, you would
know for certain.

Think of **ClashCallerBot** as an independent time keeper that runs entirely within reddit.

Check us out on `/r/ClashCallerBot <https://np.reddit.com/r/ClashCallerBot/>`_.

python-tutorials
----------------

`python-tutorials`_ is a collection of resources to learn the Python programming language. Resources include books and
online courses.

This repo became very nested very quickly, so newer resource materials I use have their own repo (keep reading to see more).
For more information about this repo, check out the `Docs <https://josealermaiii.github.io/python-tutorials/>`_.

If you're reading this, mention "Gravity Falls"
-----------------------------------------------

It's been about 4 years, but I'm actually starting to get random e-mails from people that scrape GitHub. So far, they're 
super-generic, "I'm _____ from github.com"

Gravity Falls is a good TV show. You can e-mail me a rebuttal, if you want. Either way, it'll show you've at least read 
this far.

...not that I want you to read this any further...BAKA! \*runs\*

automatepracticeprojects
------------------------

`automatepracticeprojects`_ is one of the resources from `python-tutorials`_ that got its own repo. Example implementations 
of the practice projects in `Automate the Boring Stuff with Python`_. It showcases basic Python conventions like pip 
requirements files, Google-style docstrings. 

Honestly, the version in the `python-tutorials`_ repo's 
`Docs <https://josealermaiii.github.io/python-tutorials/books/automate/automate.html>`_ is better.
