GitHub Projects
===============

This is a summary of my projects on GitHub.

A sort of appendix to my main website: `JoseALerma.com`_

.. _JoseALerma.com: https://JoseALerma.com

impracticalpythonprojects
-------------------------

`impracticalpythonprojects`_ is the first resource that got its own repo. They're example
implementations of the practice and challenge projects in `Impractical Python Projects`_.

The practice and challenge projects are *truly* impractical, but they teach useful data analysis and processing techniques.

The repo showcases more intermediate Python conventions and modules like:

* extensive testing with ``unittest``, ``tox``, and `Travis-CI`_.
* 100% `code coverage`_ with ``coverage`` and ``coveralls``.
* linting with ``pylint`` and ``pydocstyle``.
* `documentation`_ with ``sphinx``.

and the usual Google-style docstrings, pip requirements files, and main functions.

clashcallerbot-reddit
---------------------

`ClashCaller Bot`_ helps `/r/ClashOfClans <https://np.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans>`_ clans coordinate attacks during
`Clan Wars <https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Wars>`_ (or `Clan War Leagues
<https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_War_Leagues>`_) from within reddit.

It uses Python and the PRAW libraries to interface with the reddit API to scan comments for a string, save parts of
the string to a MySQL/MariaDB database, then automatically send replies via PM and comment.

The `Docs <https://josealermaiii.github.io/clashcallerbot-reddit/>`_ offer more details about usage, installation, and
frequently asked questions.

If you're reading this, mention "Gravity Falls"
-----------------------------------------------

It's been about 4 years, but I'm actually starting to get random e-mails from people that scrape GitHub. So far, they're 
super-generic, "I'm _____ from github.com"

Gravity Falls is a good TV show. You can e-mail me a rebuttal, if you want. Either way, it'll show you've at least read 
this far.

python-tutorials
----------------

`python-tutorials`_ is a collection of resources to learn the Python programming language. Resources include books and
online courses.

This repo became very nested very quickly, so newer resource materials I use have their own repo (like `impracticalpythonprojects`_).
For more information about this repo, check out the `Docs <https://josealermaiii.github.io/python-tutorials/>`_.

The `Docs <https://josealermaiii.github.io/python-tutorials/getting_started/installation.html>`_ also include information
about configuring a Python environment/IDE.

automatepracticeprojects
------------------------

`automatepracticeprojects`_ is one of the resources from `python-tutorials`_ that got its own repo. They're example implementations 
of the practice projects in `Automate the Boring Stuff with Python`_. It showcases basic Python conventions like pip 
requirements files and Google-style docstrings. 

Honestly, the version in the `python-tutorials`_ repo's 
`Docs <https://josealermaiii.github.io/python-tutorials/AutomateTheBoringStuff.html>`_ is better.
